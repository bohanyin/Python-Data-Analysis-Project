# Python-Data-Analysis-Project
This project analyzed the proportion of complains that are sustained according to different 
categories, and it also allows users to check the background of accused officers using 
jupyter notebook. In particular, users can check the background of accused officers by 
looking at the plot that shows the amount of awards they received as well as the amount 
of complaints they received.

The source datasets used in this project are from Chicago Police Database, and
the files recording complaints on officers from 2000 to 2016, including accused officers, 
victims and investigators, and the file of award records that officers received 
from 1967 to 2017.
